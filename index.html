            <p>I don't know what to say, but potatoes are incredible 
                vegetables. Scientists estimate there are over 3000 
                varieties and that our favourite little tubers have been a
                round for over
                 3000 years. Remember the potato famine? Potatoes were
                  there. Remember the potato famine part II.? 
                  Potatoes were there too. Ol' Cooko discovers Australia? POTATOES.</p>
            <p>Anyways this is just a tribute to the lil' guys. Don't want them to rise up and destroy us humans after all.</p>
